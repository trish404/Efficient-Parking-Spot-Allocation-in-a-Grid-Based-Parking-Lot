# 🚗 Optimized Parking Spot Allocation Using a Novel Hybrid Algorithm

This project implements a dynamic and intelligent parking management system using a novel hybrid algorithm that optimizes spot allocation and exit path determination. By comparing the efficiency of five algorithms—including Dijkstra's, Bellman-Ford, Content-Based Search (CBS), Jump Point Search (JPS), and a newly proposed Combined Search Algorithm—this system improves both speed and resource utilization in urban parking environments.

## 📄 Abstract

Parking management in urban areas faces significant challenges, including congestion, inefficient allocation, and unauthorized use of spaces. Building on a prior dynamic parking framework using a grid structure with long-term and short-term zones, this project introduces a novel **Combined Search Algorithm**.

📌 Key Result:  
The Combined Search Algorithm improves allocation and exit time by:
- 18% over Dijkstra's
- 25% over Bellman-Ford
- 20% over CBS
- 15% over JPS

The system ensures optimal resource usage, minimal user conflict, and faster turnaround time.
